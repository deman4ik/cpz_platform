        "4": "The signals go out once a day at about the same time so it’s easy to follow manually. Just repeat the orders (buy, sell or stop/limit orders). It’s important to place an order in advance, because you can skip the necessary moment.\n\n",

        "8": "There are 2 type of messages: '💸 New Trade!' and '🚨 New Signal!'.\n\n 💸 New Trade means the buy/sell market trade.\nExamples:\nIf you see in '💸 New Trade' only entry (Entry: 'SELL ⬇️ (Short 🔴)' or Entry: 'BUY ⬆️ (Long ✳️)' - it means that robot opened new position. For copy this action you just need to buy or sell at the same price.\nIf you also see in '💸 New Trade' exit (Exit: 'SELL ⬇️ (Close Long ✳️)' or Exit: 'BUY ⬆️ (Close Short 🔴)' - it means that robot closed the position. You should do the same.\n\n'🚨 New Signal' means the price at which you should make the trade in the future.\nThe signals can be both for opening and closing the position. You can just place the stop order at this price and wait for it execution or new next signal. When next signal is appeared and previous order is not executed - cancel previous order and create a new one.",

Open Bitfinex terminal.\n2. Choose the required cryptocurrency in Tickers window.\n3. Then under the Tickers window you have Order form.\n4. Choose margin, then stop order.\n5. In the field stop price place the price from the signal (3.0687). In the field amount choose the amount of cryptocurrency you want to trade.\n6. Click Margin Buy cause we have in signal “Action: BUY”.\nIn the middle you will have the window Orders where you will see this order. You can cancel or modify this orders with the buttons on the right.\n\nOn Kraken you should go to New order window, then choose advanced. The fields are the same. But on Kraken you need to choose the leverage for margin trading.\nEvery exchange has a bit different interface for creating orders and trading so you should learn the user manual of your exchange.",
